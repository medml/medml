# MedML
MedML is a student-driven organization based at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on bringing ML to medical education through STEP1-style medical examples.
Using an approach that uses a combination of videos, interactive tools, and direct Python code, our goal is to build an environment for medical students to gain hands on learning and problem-solving in ML.

## What is machine learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a fancy name for letting the computer find patters in your data.
As physicians (to-be) we'll rely more and more on ML to tell us what complicated patterns in our patients are worth exploring for diagnostics and treatment.

## Fall 2020
* Intro to ML in Medicine (August 23rd @1pm EDT)
* Building a Linear Regression Model (TBD)
* Bias in Medical ML

## Spring 2020
In the Spring of 2020 we launched MedML with two workshops.
These workshops will be redone for the Fall 2020 session but in case they're helpful you can find them here:
* Videos
* Notebooks
