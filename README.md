# MedML
MedML is a student-driven organization based at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on bringing Machine Learning (ML) to medical education through medical examples.

Using a combination of videos and interactive Python code, our goal is to bring ML to medical students in an accessible, fun way. Importantly, we assume no math or coding background: MedML is meant for _everyone_.

## What is machine learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a fancy name for letting the computer find patterns in your data.

As physicians (to-be) we'll rely more and more on ML to tell us what complicated patterns in our patients are worth exploring for **diagnostics and treatment**.

## Spring 2020
In the Spring of 2020 we launched MedML with two workshops.
These workshops will be redone for the Fall 2020 session but in case they're helpful you can find them here:
