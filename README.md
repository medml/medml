# MedML @ Emory
MedML is a student-driven organization based at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on making Machine Learning (ML) accessible to medical audiences.

Our approach is simple: empower medical students to effectively use ML in their clinical and research efforts. 
We use a combination of videos, articles, and interactive Python code to provide a hands-on introduction to ML that aims to make students more comfortable in exploring the amazing ML resources already out there.

## What is machine learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a fancy way of saying "let the computer find how my variables are related". 
Physicians care a lot about patterns, especially physiologic ones, because they can tell us ways to help patients with their illnesses.
ML, when effectively and ethically used, is a useful way for physicians to learning patterns in otherwise messy clinical data - with or without experiments.
