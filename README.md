# MedML @ Emory
MedML is a student-driven organization based at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on bringing Machine Learning (ML) to medical audiences in an accessible way.

Our goal is simple: empower medical students to effectively use ML in their research and clinical efforts. We rely on a combination of videos, articles, and interactive Python code to give medical students a hands-on way to get familiar with ML and feel more comfortable in using the amazing ML resources available. 

## What is machine learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a fancy name for letting the computer find patterns in your data. Physicians care deeply about patterns, using them to figure out what's wrong with our patient's physiology and how we can fix it to make the feel better. ML is a powerful tool to help us because it can find these patterns in otherwise messy clinical data.
