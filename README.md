# MedML @ Emory
MedML is a student-driven organization at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on introducing Machine Learning (ML) to medical students, from the medical angle.
Our goal is to make ML tools and resources accessible to anyone in healthcare, whatever their education or background.

Our approach is simple: get hands on as quick as possible.
We use a combination of videos, articles, and interactive Python code to provide a hands-on introduction to ML that aims to make students more comfortable in exploring the amazing ML resources already out there.

## What is machine learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a fancy way of saying "let the computer find how my variables are related". 
Physicians care a lot about patterns, especially physiologic ones, because they can tell us which patterns are involved in health and which patterns in disease.
We then have specific patterns we can target with treatments.

ML, when effectively and ethically used, is a powerful tool in the physician's toolbox - we can identify clinically relevant patterns in our patients even in the messy world of clinical medicine.
