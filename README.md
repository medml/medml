# MedML @ Emory
MedML is a student-driven organization at Emory/GeorgiaTech focused on introducing Machine Learning (ML) to medical students, from a medical angle.
Our goal is to make ML tools and resources accessible to anyone in healthcare, whatever their education or background.

## What is machine learning (ML)? 
ML is letting computers find patterns in our data.
That's it. Everything else, like checking whether those patterns are meaningful, needs physicians.
Especially physicians that understand the capabilities, and limitations, of ML.

### Approach
Our approach is simple: get hands on as quick as possible.
We use a combination of [videos](#videos), [articles](#articles), and interactive Python [code](#interactive-notebooks) to give a hands-on introduction to ML that aims to make students more comfortable in exploring the amazing ML resources already out there.

## Interactive Notebooks
These notebooks use Python code to illustrate concepts in ML.
Feel free to use that code as a foundation for your own projects if you'd like!
